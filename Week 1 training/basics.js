// Basics
// JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.

// JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word वस्तु (which means "thing" in Hindi) could be used as a variable name.
const वस्तु= "Thing";

// the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.

// In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).

// A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.

// It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.

// The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)

let int = 1;
let string= "Hello, world!";
let float = true;
var str= "Hello, world!";

console.log(int +" " + string+" " + float+" " + str+ " "+वस्तु);
